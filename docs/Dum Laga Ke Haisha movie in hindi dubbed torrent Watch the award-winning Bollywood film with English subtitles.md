- "Dum Laga Ke Haisha is a film that celebrates the beauty of imperfection and the power of love. It shows that physical appearance is not the only criterion for choosing a partner, and that one should look beyond the superficial and appreciate the inner qualities of a person." - Shilpa Jamkhandikar, Reuters[^1^]
- "Dum Laga Ke Haisha works perfectly well as an offbeat romantic comedy. But lurking beneath its good-natured humour is a critique of parents, siblings and friends who are oblivious to an individual's needs." - Nandini Ramnath, Scroll.in[^1^]
- "Dum Laga Ke Haisha banks on Bhumi to make her character accessible enough to relate yet spirited enough to inspire. The newcomer doesn't let you down." - Sukanya Verma, Rediff.com[^1^]
- "DLKH brings the much needed freshness in Bollywood romance movies. And it comes with a very strong message woven around a very sweet love story. The direction is impeccable with moderated melodrama." - jay-techie2007, IMDb user[^2^]
- "Dumb Laga Ke Haisha is a movie that celebrates the unfounding of size and space, and juxtaposes it against the flight of ambitions in a detailed, layered, yet breezy romance that acts as both a social commentary, as well as a mainstream romantic comedy." - ayanpal1, IMDb user[^2^]

The film has also won several awards and nominations, including the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi, the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for Bhumi Pednekar, and the Screen Award for Best Dialogue for Sharat Katariya.
